  <p><h1>Hello world! This is my first website!</h1></p>
  <p>Instructions: rewrite this page by adding a few sentences about yourself. Add a heading. Post it to your basecamp
  <br> Hello! My Name is Michael G, I was born in Chicago and have lived here most of my life, in fact only 10 minutes from IIT.
  <br> I am a Psychology major and I just want to smoothen out my skillset for a future helping other people, perhaps I can make a website with my personal reccomendations for vocational rehabilitation resources
  <br> I really like Musicals and singing is one of few things that gives meaning to my life as a whole
  <br> I hope to learn much from this class, as of right now I obviously only know how to break lines and encode a heading but I hope to be a farcry from this by the end of the semester!
